## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

There are several different ways to display the various image sizes with different media screens.  I chose to use grid to get the image to overlap the header.  I used object-fit and object-position to position the image.

I also experimented with setting position absolute and moving the image where I needed it but decieded to try object position instead (which was my first time using object-position).



### Continued development

More practice with grid, flexbox and images.
